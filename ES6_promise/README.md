# <p align="center">ES6 Promise</p>

## üìù Description
This project, entitled "ES6 Promises", is a set of practical exercises designed to deepen the understanding and application of the Promises in ES6 JavaScript. It aims to educate about the use of the methods `then`, `resolve`, `catch`, the `await` operator, and the creation of `async` functions. This project is essential for developers looking to master asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## üìö Resources
- [JavaScript Promise: An introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [Async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
- [Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
- [Throw/Try](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw)
- [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](https://eslint.org/)
- [Jest - Delightful JavaScript Testing](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used
- **Node.js**: Execution environment for server-side JavaScript.
- **Jest**: Test framework for JavaScript.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool for JavaScript.
- **Babel**: JavaScript transpilator to support the latest features of ES6.

## üìã Prerequisite
- `NodeJS` version 12.11.x or newer.
- `NPM` (Node Package Manager) version 6.11.3 or newer.
- A text editor such as `Visual Studio Code`, `vim`, or `emacs`.

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

1. Install NodeJS:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```
2. Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

3. Install Jest, Babel and ESLint in your project directory:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/cli eslint
```

4. Clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/
```

5. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ES6_promise
```

## üí° Use
To run the tests of each task, use the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm run test
```

## ‚ú® Main Features

- **Promise Management**: Understand and effectively use promises in JavaScript.
- **Async/Await**: Master asynchronous functions and the await operator for non-blocking operations.
- **Error management**: Use `try/catch` to manage errors in asynchronous operations.
- **ESLint**: Configure and use ESLint to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.
- **Jest**: Write and run tests using the Jest framework.

## üìù Task List
0. **Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep**: Learn to create promises and understand their importance.
1. **Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it**: Manage the promises and their resolution or rejection according to the conditions.
2. **Catch me if you can!**: Management of errors and rejections in promises.
3. **Handle multiple successful promises**: Work with several promises and manage their collective resolution.
4. **Simple promise**: Create a simple promise returning a specific object.
5. **Reject the promises**: Write functions that reject promises with errors.
6. **Multiple handle promises**: Manage several promises and their states with `Promise.all`.
7. **Load balancer**: Implement a load balancer using promises.
8. **Throw an error**: Manage exceptions by throwing errors under certain conditions.
9. **Throw error / try catch**: Use `try/catch` to manage errors in promises.
10. **Await / Async**: Use the `async` and `await` functions to simplify the processing of asynchronous operations.
