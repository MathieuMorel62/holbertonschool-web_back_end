It includes the creation of authentication classes, error management, the use of Base64 for encoding authentication information, and securing API routes. This project provides an in-depth understanding of the authentication mechanism in web applications.

- [**Session Authentication**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/Session_authentication): This project builds on the basic authentication system by adding session authentication. It includes the creation of a session authentication class, the use of cookies to store session information, and the implementation of a session expiration policy.

- [**User Authentication Service**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/user_authentication_service): This project implements a complete authentication service using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and bcrypt. It includes features such as user modeling, session and token management, integration with Flask, and advanced security features for a robust authentication system.

- [**Unittests And Integration Tests**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/Unittests_and_integration_tests): This project focuses on unit testing and integration testing in software development. It aims to teach good testing practices, using Python as the main language. The project aims to teach how to differentiate between unit tests and integration tests, how to use common test models such as mocking and parameterisation, and how to implement effective tests to ensure code quality.

- [**i18n**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/i18n): The i18n project is a multilingual web application developed as part of a web programming project. The main objective is to create a Flask application capable of managing several languages, with an emphasis on internationalization and localization. The project involves the use of Babel for the management of translations and the personalization of content according to the user's language.

- [**MySQL Advanced**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/MySQL_Advanced): The MySQL Advanced project is an in-depth exploration of the advanced features of MySQL. This project highlights concepts such as creating tables with constraints, optimizing queries by adding indexes, and implementing stored procedures, functions, views and triggers in MySQL. The main objective is to provide an in-depth understanding of these advanced aspects and to improve MySQL database management skills.

- [**NoSQL**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/NoSQL): The NoSQL project is designed to provide a thorough and practical understanding of NoSQL databases. It covers the fundamental concepts of NoSQL, the differences from traditional SQL databases, and examples of implementation using MongoDB. This project allows users to master basic operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as complex queries and data aggregation.

- [**ES6 Basics**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/ES6_basic): The ES6 Basics project is an in-depth exploration of the features of ECMAScript 6, offering an overview of the new features and improvements made to the JavaScript language. This project covers key concepts such as const and let variables, arrow functions, default settings, spread and rest operators, as well as new methods for strings and objects.

- [**ES6 Promises**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/blob/main/ES6_promise/) The ES6 Promises project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of promises in JavaScript. It covers the basics of promises, including creating, resolving, and rejecting promises, as well as chaining promises and handling errors. This project aims to help users master the use of promises in asynchronous JavaScript programming.

- [**ES6 Classes**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/ES6_classes): The ES6 Classes project is designed to explore and implement advanced concepts of object-oriented programming in ES6 JavaScript.
