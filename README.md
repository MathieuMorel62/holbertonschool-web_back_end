# Welcome to web back end repository

## About this deposit
This GitHub repository is a showcase of my skills and achievements in back-end web development. It contains a series of projects and exercises highlighting my expertise in Python, especially in areas such as asynchronous understanding, asynchronous functions and variable annotations.

## Key projects

- [**Python_variable_annotations**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_variable_annotations): An example illustrating the importance of variable annotations to improve the clarity and maintenance of the code.

- [**Python_async_function**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_async_function): Explore the impact and benefits of asynchronous functions in the development of modern web applications.

- [**Python_async_comprehension**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_async_comprehension): A project demonstrating the use of asynchronous understanding in Python to effectively process data.
