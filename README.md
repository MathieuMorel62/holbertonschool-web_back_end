## About this deposit
This GitHub repository is a showcase of my skills and achievements in back-end web development. It contains a series of projects and exercises highlighting my expertise in Python, especially in areas such as asynchronous understanding, asynchronous functions and variable annotations.

## Key projects

- [**Python_variable_annotations**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_variable_annotations): An example illustrating the importance of variable annotations to improve the clarity and maintenance of the code.

- [**Python_async_function**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_async_function): Explore the impact and benefits of asynchronous functions in the development of modern web applications.

- [**Python_async_comprehension**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/python_async_comprehension): A project demonstrating the use of asynchronous understanding in Python to effectively process data.

- [**Caching**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/caching): This project focuses on learning different caching algorithms, including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU. Through Python scripts, various caching systems are implemented, each with specific characteristics and eviction policies.

- [**Pagination**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/pagination): A project covering data pagination, including basic pagination techniques with page and page size parameters, pagination using hypermedia metadata, and data deletion-resistant pagination

- [**Personal Data**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/personal_data): Advanced management of personal data security using Python, featuring functionalities like PII obfuscation in logs and secure password hashing practices.

- [**Basic Authentication**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_back_end/tree/main/Basic_authentication): This project aims to implement a basic authentication system in an API. It includes the creation of authentication classes, error management, the use of Base64 for encoding authentication information, and securing API routes. This project provides an in-depth understanding of the authentication mechanism in web applications.
